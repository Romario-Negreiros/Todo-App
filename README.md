## Overview

### Built with

### What I learned

Some of the most important things I learned is how to use react hooks, as i am a newbie with react, it was a great practice for learning how to use the basics of this feature.
I also learned how to add some other libraries to my projects, how to deploy and host my site, using vercel.
