### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Hooks

- [SweetAlert-v1](https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/) - JS library

### What I learned

Some of the most important things I learned is how to use react hooks, as i am a newbie with react, it was a great practice for learning how to use the basics of this feature.
I also learned how to add some other libraries to my projects, how to deploy and host my site, using [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
